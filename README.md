# Uriel

- Uriel is a system monitoring and detection tool designed for Unix-based systems

- This was a personal project to create a script that detects my computer's specifications, identifies if Coreboot is installed, and displays the information in a text-based user interface (TUI)

- Overall, this Bash script gathers and displays system information, including CPU, RAM, disk usage, Coreboot, GRUB, Libreboot, battery status, fan speeds, and load averages.
